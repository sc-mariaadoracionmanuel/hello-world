Im currently wactching CARMEN CURLERS. It is inspired by actual events and takes off in 1963, when the entrepreneur Axel stumbles upon an invention: The electric curler. A revolutionary invention with a potential to liberate women with an easy, quick, and cheap way to get curly hair in just 10 minutes instead of spending hours at the hair salon.
In 1963, a business adventure begins in a basement in a small Danish town. Within a few years, the company has 3500 employees, many of them are women who are experiencing for the first time the joys and challenges of earning their own money.
